# DLG-angular

# Used Direct Line Group's logo on the Homepage as a sample.

# Used Font Awesome to use Nunito Sans font.

# Initially Submit button is disabled to give an good User Experience and when the user fills all the data in the form, button will be enabled automatically.

# Given dummy Login links at the bottom of the page and also on Success banner just to show the look and feel of a Signup page.

# On submitting the form with fully completed form, I have used Mocky API to get a mock response.
